        The motivation for this project is to visualize how students' stress
        changes over the duration of an exam. As students ourselves, we
        resonated with this data. Because there are many different aspects to
        this, such as the 4 different types of stress level measures (heart
        rate, electrodermal activity, etc.), and also the type of exam (Midterm
        1/2, Final), an interactive visualization is the best way to contain all
        the information, and enable viewers to filter what specific aspects they
        want to see. Additionally, since there is so much data, we found it
        beneficial to track certain stressor levels at a certain point in time.
        We included our slider to sync with our graph and body so we can
        simultaneously see the average values of all the different measures
        across the different exams, but also the audience's chosen measure +
        exams.

        Originally, our dataset contained stressor level information measured in 
        different rates per second for different measures so we had to
        aggregate our data to unify our measurement rates and to make all students' 
        start times align since all students had slightly different start times.
        Additionally we calculated average values amongst students (every percent of the
        way done with the exam) so viewers can see a compressed, but more
        interpretable, version of the data. Since midterms and finals had
        different alotted times, changing them into one scale (test progress)
        allowed us to combine and overlay everything. We made sure to include a
        color palette that makes different exams easily distinguishable from
        each other, and also a color scale that differentiates between low and
        high.

        To develop this project, we experimented with D3 and utilized a lot of
        knowledge from past labs, and new ideas. For example, we included a
        tooltip that allows users to interact with the graph and see exactly
        what the data value is. We experimented with EventListeners and further
        enabled interactivity, through intentional colors, sliders, and check
        boxes.
