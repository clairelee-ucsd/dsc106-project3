      The motivation for this project is to visualize how students' stress
      changes over the duration of an exam, and how different stressor vary
      throughout different exams. As students ourselves, we resonated with this
      data, and think instructors can benefit as well through understanding
      student perspectives. Because there are many different aspects to this,
      such as the 4 different types of stress level measures (heart rate,
      electrodermal activity, etc.), and also the type of exam (Midterm 1/2,
      Final), an interactive visualization is the best way to contain all the
      information, and enable viewers to filter what specific aspects they want
      to see. Additionally, since there is so much data, we found it beneficial
      to track certain stressor levels at a certain point in time. We included
      our slider to sync with our graph and body so we can simultaneously see
      the average values of all the different measures across the different
      exams, but also visually, the audience's chosen measure + exams. The
      slider connects the graph with the human body. This is valuable because
      our goal is to visualize how stressors change over time.

      Some alternative we considered were using a different dataset (such as one
      that was previously used from the last project, such as the mouse
      dataset). We also considered using the data to predict students' scores,
      and originally wanted our project to involve each students' final scores.
      However, we decided to aggregate all the information together so we can
      see common trends.

      Our development process was lengthy. Originally, our dataset contained
      stressor level information measured in different rates per second for
      different measures so we had to aggregate our data to unify our
      measurement rates and to make all students' start times align since all
      students had slightly different start times. Additionally we calculated
      average values amongst students (every percent of the way done with the
      exam) so viewers can see a compressed, but more interpretable, version of
      the data. Since midterms and finals had different alotted times, changing
      them into one scale (test progress) allowed us to combine and overlay
      everything. We made sure to include a color palette that makes different
      exams easily distinguishable from each other, and also a color scale that
      differentiates between low and high. After cleaning and aggregating the
      data, we created the checkboxes and radio buttons, and all the layouts for
      the graphs, body, and slider. From there, we implemented the data by
      graphing the points based off of the checked boxes / radio buttons, and
      displaying the measures at a certain time next to the human, aligned with
      the slider.

      To develop this project, we experimented with D3 and utilized a lot of
      knowledge from past labs, and new ideas. For example, we included a
      tooltip that allows users to interact with the graph and see exactly what
      the data value is at a certain point. We experimented with EventListeners
      and further enabled interactivity, through intentional colors, sliders,
      and check boxes. We specifically wanted a slider because it involves
      movement, and that is engaging for audience.

      For this project, Ada worked on creating the filters and slidebar as well 
      as making them functional (15-20 hours). Claire worked on displaying the 
      data on the graph (15-20 hours). Jenny worked with color coding the body 
      according to daat inputs and well as updating the measurement values to 
      be displayed (12-15 hours). Michelle worked on adding the vertical line 
      and cleaning up the project (8-12 hours). We also worked ~10 hours as a 
      group together to brainstorm and debug. It took the longest time making 
      the different interactions work together and styling the website so that 
      the layout is ideal. Additionally, working with Github was difficult 
      because merging our changes often created conflicts.
