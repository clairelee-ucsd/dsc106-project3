      The motivation for this project is to visualize how students' stress
      changes over the duration of an exam, and how different stress indicators vary
      throughout different exams. As students ourselves, we resonated with this
      data, and think instructors can benefit as well through understanding
      student perspectives. Instructors may use this information to decide which 
      questions should be easier so they dont overwhelm the students, while students
      can use this information to decide when to drink their last sip of water to 
      calm themselves down according to which test they are taking. Because 
      there are many different aspects in this project, such as the 4 different 
      types of stress level measures (heart rate, electrodermal activity, etc.),
      and also the type of exam (Midterm 1/2, Final), we decided an interactive 
      visualization is the best way to contain all the information and 
      enable viewers to filter what specific aspects they want to see. 
      Additionally, since there is so much data, we found it beneficial
      to track certain stressor levels at a certain point in time. We included
      our slider to sync with our graph and body so we can simultaneously see
      the average values of all the different measures across the different
      exams, but also visually, the audience's chosen measure + exams. This is 
      valuable because our goal is to visualize how stressors change over time.

      Some alternatives we considered were using a different dataset (such as the mouse
      dataset). We also considered using the data to predict students' scores,
      and originally wanted our project to involve each students' final scores.
      However, too much information may overwhelm the audience and so we decided to just 
      focus on when students are most stressed in the duration of exams, rather than to 
      correlate stress with scores.

      To explore the question, we decided to make use of a human body, making it easier
      for people to place themselves into the position of the test taker, and applied 
      a color-scheme to represent stress level where blue is low stress (typically 
      relating to a chill and calm feeling) and red is high stress (typically relating to 
      anger/heat/stress). Since we are using a continuos color scale, we decided to add a color 
      legend with a pointer so our audience can easily see whether stress levels 
      are increasing or decreasing (since it may be harder to identify with the 
      color change) as they move the slider. We also chose to include filters on 
      exams and stress indicators since the stress trend may vary for different 
      exams. For example, if you play around with our interactive visualization,
      you may find students more stressed in the earlier stages of midterm 1 while 
      for midterm 2, students' stress levels are higher past the half point of the test.
      We want to account for these differences which would be lost if we were to just
      aggregate all 3 test measurements. For the filter on stress indicators, we wanted
      to allow the audience to easily see the trends of each measure for the test(s)
      chosen. It allows for easier compare and contrast because the colored dots on the graph
      indicates the measurement of a stress indicator for a specific exam and if all 3 tests
      are chosen, 3 plots would be shown in the graph, allowing for direct comparison in 
      one glance. We also included a red line to track the slidebar's position in the graph 
      so the audience can immediately see the measurements at the time of the test that they
      chose with the slidebar.

      Our development process was lengthy. Originally, our dataset contained
      stressor level information measured in different rates per second for
      different measures so we had to aggregate our data to unify our
      measurement rates and to make all students' start times align since all
      students had slightly different start times. Additionally we calculated
      average values amongst students (every percent of the way done with the
      exam) so viewers can see a compressed, but more interpretable, version of
      the data. Since midterms and finals had different test lengths, changing
      them into one scale (test progress) allowed us to combine and overlay
      everything. We made sure to include a color palette that makes different
      exams easily distinguishable from each other, and also a color scale that
      differentiates between low and high. After cleaning and aggregating the
      data, we created the checkboxes and radio buttons, and all the layouts for
      the graphs, body, and slider. From there, we implemented the data by
      graphing the points based off of the checked boxes / radio buttons, and
      displaying the measures at a certain time next to the human, aligned with
      the slider.

      To develop this project, we experimented with D3 and utilized a lot of
      knowledge from past labs, and new ideas. For example, we included a
      tooltip that allows users to interact with the graph and see exactly what
      the data value is at a certain point. We experimented with EventListeners
      and further enabled interactivity, through intentional colors, sliders,
      and check boxes. We specifically wanted a slider because it involves
      movement, and that is engaging for audience.

      For this project, Ada worked on creating the filters and slidebar as well 
      as making them functional (15-20 hours). Claire worked on displaying the 
      data on the graph (15-20 hours). Jenny worked with color coding the body 
      according to data inputs and well as updating the measurement values to 
      be displayed (12-15 hours). Michelle worked on adding the vertical line 
      and cleaning up the project (8-12 hours). We also worked ~10 hours as a 
      group together to brainstorm and debug. It took the longest time making 
      the different interactions work together and styling the website so that 
      the layout is ideal. Additionally, working with Github was difficult 
      because merging our changes often created conflicts.
