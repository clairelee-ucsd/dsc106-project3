      The motivation for this project is to visualize how students' stress
      changes over the duration of an exam, and how different stressor vary
      throughout different exams. As students ourselves, we resonated with this
      data, and think instructors can benefit as well through understanding
      student perspectives. Because there are many different aspects to this,
      such as the 4 different types of stress level measures (heart rate,
      electrodermal activity, etc.), and also the type of exam (Midterm 1/2,
      Final), an interactive visualization is the best way to contain all the
      information, and enable viewers to filter what specific aspects they want
      to see. Additionally, since there is so much data, we found it beneficial
      to track certain stressor levels at a certain point in time. We included
      our slider to sync with our graph and body so we can simultaneously see
      the average values of all the different measures across the different
      exams, but also visually, the audience's chosen measure + exams. The
      slider connects the graph with the human body. This is valuable because
      our goal is to visualize how stressors change over time.

      Our development process was lengthy. Originally, our dataset contained
      stressor level information measured in different rates per second for
      different measures so we had to aggregate our data to unify our
      measurement rates and to make all students' start times align since all
      students had slightly different start times. Additionally we calculated
      average values amongst students (every percent of the way done with the
      exam) so viewers can see a compressed, but more interpretable, version of
      the data. Since midterms and finals had different alotted times, changing
      them into one scale (test progress) allowed us to combine and overlay
      everything. We made sure to include a color palette that makes different
      exams easily distinguishable from each other, and also a color scale that
      differentiates between low and high. After cleaning and aggregating the
      data, we created the checkboxes and radio buttons, and all the layouts for
      the graphs, body, and slider. From there, we implemented the data by
      graphing the points based off of the checked boxes / radio buttons, and
      displaying the measures at a certain time next to the human, aligned with
      the slider.

      To develop this project, we experimented with D3 and utilized a lot of
      knowledge from past labs, and new ideas. For example, we included a
      tooltip that allows users to interact with the graph and see exactly what
      the data value is at a certain point. We experimented with EventListeners
      and further enabled interactivity, through intentional colors, sliders,
      and check boxes.

      For this project, Ada worked on creating the layouts and buttons. Claire
      worked on displaying the data on the graph. Jenny worked with the slider
      and connecting it to the body. Michelle worked on adding the vertical line
      and cleaning up the project. It took a lot of time debugging when data
      wasn't displayed, or changing the layout.
